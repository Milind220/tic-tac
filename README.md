### Tic-Tac-Toe game that runs in your terminal or command-line!

Two players can play against each other, using the numbers 1-9 to enter either an X or O into the 3x3 grid. 
A guide grid is shown alongside, to help players understand what moves remain and what number to press for each one.
Not a bad way to kill some time (if you're super super super bored)

### To Run
Clone the repo/get the zip file and run main.py, making sure the other files are in the same directory.

Let me know what you think!
